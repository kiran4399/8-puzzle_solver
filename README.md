# AI: 8 puzzle solver


By using BFS, DFS solve the 8-puzzle sliding tiles problem. Given a start state and goal state, your program should give the path, if it exists.
Find the average time taken for both these strategies. You need to give average time (actual time) taken along with its standard deviation. Similarly, you need to give the average size of the closed list along with its standard deviation.
